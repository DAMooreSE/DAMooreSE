# Embedded Systems in Android Applications
> This class consisted of weekly labs, where we used Java in Android Studio and SDK to create various small android applications such as a calculator, stopwatch, etc that built up to a final project where pairs of developers teamed up to create a larger and more fleshed out application. 
> For our final project, my partner and I had a mutual need for a more powerful application for creating and editing lists so we designed and created a list application with various additional functionality compared to a basic list app.
> I have included a copy of our requirements for the application to show which features were developed and implemented for our project.
