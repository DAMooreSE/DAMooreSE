# Dungeon Crawler Application Rendered in a Command Prompt
- Classwork consisted of implementing additional functionality into a single software application weekly, where the application was a 2D dungeon crawler game that rendered inside a command prompt and was developed on Linux using C initially, and then converting the project and continuting development using C++.
- The project used the agile methodology during development as well as using Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment to continuously implement new features or changes into the games with each sprint.
- I have included a screenshot of how the map would render early on in development as well as a screenshot from the professors game that our project used as the foundation for development.
