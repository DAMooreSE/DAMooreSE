Team followed an agile-based development process where we’d meet every week to discuss what’s been worked on, what needs worked on, what problems we’re having, and what we need to work on before the next meeting as well meeting with a “client” every 2 weeks to demo the progress our team has made and implement the feedback into our development plan for the next meeting.
