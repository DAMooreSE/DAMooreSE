### About my Experience:
> After graduating at the end of 2020, I had to take some time off for my health before being able to begin my career last October with a freelancing opportunity, so a majority of my experience comes from my classwork in college. My experience encompasses 164 credit hours of Education over Software Engineering and other required subjects required for completion of the Bachelors of Science program at Iowa State University of Science and Technology, as well as 7 months of professional experience working with a client doing freelance software engineering.

# **Project Overviews**
From the wide variety and range of work done in the classroom, I've listed the projects that I learned the most from or that I thought showcased some of the knowledge that I have, as well as the freelance project that I'm currently working on.


### [Embedded Systems in Android Applications](https://github.com/DAMooreSE/DAMooreSE/tree/main/Projects%20and%20Experience/Android%20-%20Embedded%20Systems%20In%20Android%20Applications)
 > Class consisted of weekly labs, where we used Java in Android Studio and SDK to create various small android applications such as a calculator, stopwatch, etc that built up to a final project where pairs of developers teamed up to create a larger and more fleshed out application.


### [Multiplayer UNO Android Game Application](https://github.com/DAMooreSE/DAMooreSE/tree/main/Projects%20and%20Experience/Android%20-%20Multiplayer%20UNO%20Android%20Game%20Application)
 > Class focused on using standard software development practices in small teams to develop some software application. Our team decided to develop an Android Application that allowed a user to play the UNO card game against either a computer or other players over a network connection.


### [Embedded Systems Interfacing with Microcontrollers using Cybot Interface](https://github.com/DAMooreSE/DAMooreSE/tree/main/Projects%20and%20Experience/C%20-%20Embedded%20Systems%20Cybot%20Interfacing%20Using%20Microcontrollers)
 > Used C in weekly labs to develop applications to be run on an embedded system, a roomba robot with additional logic boards, as well as a final project where we developed an automated navigation program that allowed the robot to traverse an obstacle course to reach and stop on a specific part of the course.


### [Dungeon Crawler Game Application Rendered Inside a Command Prompt](https://github.com/DAMooreSE/DAMooreSE/tree/main/Projects%20and%20Experience/Java%20-%20Dungeon%20Crawler%20Application%20Rendered%20in%20a%20Command%20Prompt)
 > Classwork consisted of implementing additional functionality into a single software application weekly, where the application was a 2D dungeon crawler game that rendered inside a command prompt and was developed using C initially and then converted to C++.


### [Dungeon Destroyer Web Browser Game Application](https://github.com/DAMooreSE/DAMooreSE/tree/main/Projects%20and%20Experience/JavaScript%20-%20Dungeon%20Destoryer%20Web%20Browser%20Game)
 > Rouge-lite 2D Dungeon Crawler Web Browser Game. Game developed using Phaser.IO engine thatâ€™s hosted locally using Node JS.


### [Applying Blockchain to Energy Delivery Systems](https://sdmay20-12.sd.ece.iastate.edu/)
 > The integrity of measurements, commands, and authenticity of control devices performing communication are critical for trusted operations in our Energy Delivery Systems. The use of blockchain technology was hypothesized to provide a secure network for managing Energy Delivery Systems by removing the dependency on a central service and ensure extra security of the network by using a permissioned blockchain system.


### [Code Clapper](https://github.com/DAMooreSE/DAMooreSE/tree/main/Projects%20and%20Experience/JavaScript%20-%20Code%20Clapper)
 > Contracted to develop a web application that has a recording utility run on a host machine, that can be controlled remotely on another device and supports MacOS.
