# Embedded Systems Cybot Interfacing Using Microcontrollers
> Used C in weekly labs to develop applications to be run on an embedded system, a roomba robot with additional logic boards, as well as a final project where we developed an automated navigation program that allowed the robot to traverse an obstacle course to reach and stop on a specific part of the course.
> I have included a copy of our final block diagram for the project as well as pictures of the roomba we programmed and an example obstacle course during the final project.
