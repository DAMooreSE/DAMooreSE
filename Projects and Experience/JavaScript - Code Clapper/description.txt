Code Clapper is a web application that has a recording utility run on a host machine that can be controlled remotely on another device.
The project consisted of two components, a recorder service and the User Interface application. The project development used Javascript for development and Yarn for project management and as a package manager. The User Interface application was built using React.js and deployed using Firebase. The recorder service and its API were built using React and uses ApertureJS, a JavaScript visualization framework supporting REST services, to record audio/video on the host machine. The recorder is controlled by the User Interface that utilizes the API extended by the recording service to access and control the recorder's functionality.
