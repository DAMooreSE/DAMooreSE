# Multiplayer UNO Android Game Application
- This class focused on using standard software development practices in small teams to develop some software application. Our team decided to develop an Android Application that allowed a user to play the UNO card game against either a computer or other players over a network connection. 
- Our team followed an Agile development cycle with 2 week sprints where we'd meet and demonstrate the progress on the project, gain feedback, and discuss future tasks.
- The back-end was developed using Java, Android Studio, Spring boot, and MySQL.
- The front-end was developed using Java and Android Studio.
- I have included a copy of our final poster for the application that includes all the relevant information regarding the development of the application.
