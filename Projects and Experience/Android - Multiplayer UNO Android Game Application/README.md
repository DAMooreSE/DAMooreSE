# Multiplayer UNO Android Game Application
> This class focused on using standard software development practices in small teams to develop some software application. Our team decided to develop an Android Application that allowed a user to play the UNO card game against either a computer or other players over a network connection. Spring boot and MySQL were also used in the development of the back-end.
> I have included a copy of our requirements for the application to show which features were developed and implemented for our project.
