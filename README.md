**Hi, my name is Dakota Moore.**

I am from Council Bluffs, IA. I graduated from Lewis Central Senior High School with honors in 2014 and then attended Iowa State University until I graduated in 2020 with a Bachelor’s of Science in Software Engineering. I took a wide variety of classes that covered a wide variety of programming languages and software development methodologies. 

I had to take some time off after graduating in order to go through some surgeries I needed for my health. While recovering from my back surgery, I was contracted by an acquaintance last October to develop a software application that would enable a user to remotely control a more functional recording utility that’s running on a host machine running MacOS to aid in his production of pre-recorded lectures, and I am currently still working on this project. The project uses JavaScript, ReactJS, and Firebase for the front-end, and JavaScript, Node.JS, Yarn, Aperture-JS, and Firebase for the back-end.


**Skills**

* Extensive knowledge of Computer Science and software engineering methodologies, standard practices, and architecture designs.
* I have experience developing and deploying applications with web hosted user interfaces using technologies such as JavaScript, Yarn, React.JS, Firebase, and others.
* I have knowledge and experience following standard software development practices, such as Agile (Scrum and XP), Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), Test-driven development, Version Control, etc., while working alone and in a team.
* I have knowledge and experience creating supporting documentation using UML standards during software development..
* I am proficient or experienced with Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.JS, C, C++, SQL, and other languages/frameworks.
* Experience working in a small team to deliver software solutions, whilst establishing quality, timeliness, and team-wide adherence to architectural practice and guidelines.
* I am able to quickly learn new skills, development tools, programming languages or platforms and have experience teaching myself to use new languages and software in the development of software applications
* I have software development experience using both full stack development as well as DevOps development.
* Ability to troubleshoot and debug software development issues.
* Experience supporting a software's lifecycle with quality assurance tasks, outlining test cases, acquiring test data, executing test cases and identifying defects prior to production.
* Experience with Imperative programming, Structured Programming, and Object-oriented programming as well as others.
* Background/knowledge in Cyber Security as well as Aerospace Engineering. 



**Experience**

*Software Engineer - CodeClapper (October 2021 - Current)*
* I was contracted to be the sole software engineer working to develop Code Clapper, a web application that consists of a recording utility running on a host MacOS machine that can be controlled remotely from another device. Project work includes standard software requirements gathering and documentation, meeting with a client, as well as using JavaScript, Node.JS, Firebase, React, Yarn, Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Git, and Aperture-JS to develop a recording software application with expanded functionality that more easily allows the client to create pre-recorded lectures by reducing the amount of work needed for post-production.
* Project work can be found on github here https://github.com/DAMooreSE/codeClapper




**Education**

*BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, Iowa State University of Science and Technology*
* Graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering at Iowa State University in December of 2020. Coursework included the understanding and use of the Java, C, C++, MATLAB, MySQL, Blockchain, Docker, JavaScript, React, Node.JS, HTML5, Spring Boot, JSON, git, and Python programming software and languages, with courses specializing in object-oriented programming, data structures, cyber security, data management/manipulation, software architecture development, as well as studying algorithms and their efficiencies.

* My senior design project where I worked with in a team of developers that followed standard development practices to develop a blockchain network that was able to support the migration of public energy delivery systems, can be found here: https://sdmay20-12.sd.ece.iastate.edu/
