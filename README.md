Hi, my name is Dakota Moore.

I recently graduated from Iowa State University of Science and Technology with a Bachelors
of Science in Software Engineering in December 2020, with a 2.46 GPA.

I am very excited to apply the knowledge and experience gained during my education towards my career as a software engineer and developer.
I am experienced with designing, testing, troubleshooting and debugging, deploying, and maintaining software using industry standard 
practices and methodologies, especially when working in a team of developers. This experience includes working with Java, C, C++, MATLAB, MySQL, Blockchain,
Docker, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Firebase, Node.JS, HTML5, Spring Boot, JSON, git, Python, Visual Studio Code, and more, as well as experience creating 
documentation for requirements gathering, including translating business requirements into tasks for designing, building, testing, and maintaining efficient, reusable, 
and reliable code. I am also a fast learner and adapt to new working environments quickly. I also have a background in Aersoapce Engineering 
and Cyber Security as well.
