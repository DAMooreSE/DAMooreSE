Hi, my name is Dakota Moore.

I recently graduated from Iowa State University of Science and Technology with a Bachelors
of Science in Software Engineering in December 2020, with a 2.46 GPA.

I am very excited to apply the knowledge and experience gained during my education towards my career as a software engineer and developer.
I am experienced with designing, testing, troubleshooting and debugging, deploying, and maintaining software using industry standard 
practices and methodologies, especially when working in a team of developers. This experience includes working with Java, C, C++, MATLAB, MySQL, Blockchain,
Docker, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Firebase, Node.JS, HTML5, Spring Boot, JSON, git, Python, Visual Studio Code, and more, as well as experience creating 
documentation for requirements gathering, including translating business requirements into tasks for designing, building, testing, and maintaining efficient, reusable, 
and reliable code. I am also a fast learner and adapt to new working environments quickly. I also have a background in Aersoapce Engineering 
and Cyber Security as well.




**Skills**

* Extensive knowledge of Computer Science and software engineering methodologies, standard practices, and architecture designs. 
* Experience working in a small team to deliver solutions within an Agile (Scrum/XP) methodology, whilst establishing quality, timeliness, and team-wide adherence to architectural practice and guidelines. 
* Knowledge and experience creating supporting documentation using UML standards, such as Use-case diagrams, Architecture diagrams, project proposals, design documents, etc., for software development. 
* Proficient or experienced with Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Node.JS, C, C++, SQL, and other languages/frameworks.
* Experience with Imperative programming, Structured Programming, and Object-oriented programming as well as knowing the proper situations for each.
* Background/knowledge in Cyber Security as well as Aerospace Engineering.
* Able to quickly learn new skills, development tools, programming languages or platforms. 
* I have software development experience using both full stack development as well as DevOps development.
* Ability to troubleshoot and debug software development issues.
* Experience supporting a software's lifecycle with quality assurance tasks, outlining test cases, acquiring test data, executing test cases and identifying defects prior to production. 
* Experience developing and deploying applications to a user interface using technologies such as JavaScript, Node.JS, Yarn, React, Firebase, and others. 
* I have knowledge and experience following standard software development practices, such as Agile (Scrum and XP), Continuous-Integration/Continuous-Development/Deployment (CI/CD), Test-driven development, etc, while working both alone and in a team. 



**Experience**

*Freelance Software Developer (October 2021 - Current)*
Contracted to develop a web application that has a recording utility run on a host machine that can be
controlled remotely on another device. Project work includes standard software requirements gathering and
documentation, meeting with a client, as well as using JavaScript, Node.JS, Firebase, React, Yarn, Microsoft
Studio Code, git, and aperture to develop on MacOS.
